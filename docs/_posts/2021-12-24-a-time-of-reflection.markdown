They say the holidays should be a time where one looks back at the past year, or period of time in their life and reflects upon decisions and events in their lifetime. One is supposed to their successes and failure in a hope to gleam some insight into the highs and lows of times past in an effort to either duplicate or avoid such events. Both from a personal and societal standpoint, the location of where we stand today sometimes feels but just a few feet from where we started but contrarily it maybe a great distance from where we started.

One of the most amazing things about C#, and credit goes to all the languages designers and programmers who've worked on it, is it's amazing ability to change and adapt to current trends and needs of the community. C# is over 20, and Microsoft started working on it's design years before it was ever mentioned to the public. Many languages over the years have waxed and waned during C#'s lifetime and several even though heralded as the next big shift in computer programming never were never granted a seat at the table of major languages sustained by community support. C#, even though it was backed by one of the largest software companies in the world, was never guaranteed that spot, and some argue, it almost never made it.

Back in the mid 90's, Microsoft was in the midst of a legal battle with Sun over trademark issues of Java and J++, Delphi, based off of Turbo Pascal, was a major player in the Rapid Application Development space (RAD for short), and there was this quirky language that powered some code in these new web browsers called JavaScript. Amidst all of this, in Mid 2000, Microsoft announced is is going to release a new programming language called "C#" which looks nothing like their flagship RAD tool, Visual Basic the absolutely loved by some (and reviled by others) language of all time. The VB syntax in all it's forms powered most of Microsoft's lightweight programming tooling. Everything from VBScript in their Classic ASP system, to Office automation, to their RAD Tool which probably created the majority of workplace applications across the world. Although not officially stated, Microsoft had signaled a change in direction pertaining to their approach to software development.

Understanding the background, the stage is now set to see the world where C# 1.0 debuted. C# entered a world where for years there was a debate on whether anyone really needed any more programming languages, and on top of that, it looked extremely similar to a relatively unknown language . . . . Java. It was so similar in fact that even some of Java's quirks which could have been corrected, such as array covariance, weren't.
