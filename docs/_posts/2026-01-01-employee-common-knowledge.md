title: "Common Knowledge Is Why Employees Leave Before You Expect It"

There’s a concept in economics and game theory called **common knowledge**.

It’s not just what I know, or what you know.  
It’s what I know that you know — and what you know that I know.

That distinction matters more in management than most leaders realize.

Because when it comes to compensation, workload, and treatment, employers and employees aren’t operating in the dark. Both sides usually have a clear picture. And more importantly, both sides understand that the other does too.

Once something becomes common knowledge, you can’t pretend it’s invisible without consequences.

## What *Is* Common Knowledge

Employees usually know where they stand with you.

They know if they’re liked.  
They know if they’re tolerated.  
They know if they’re trusted, relied on, or quietly ignored.

If termination were imminent, they’d feel it by now. There would be signals: write-ups, pressure, escalation, documentation. Even in organizations that claim to be opaque, people are remarkably good at reading intent.

Silence communicates stability.  
Lack of corrective action communicates acceptance.

So while managers often believe they’re withholding information, employees are continuously inferring it.

That internal status — fair or not — is usually clear.

## What *Isn’t* Common Knowledge (And Why It Matters More)

What isn’t shared runs in the opposite direction.

You do **not** know where the employee stands externally.

You don’t know:
- whether they’ve talked to recruiters  
- whether interviews have already happened  
- whether they’re in a final round  
- whether an offer exists but hasn’t been accepted yet  

Managers often believe they’ll notice when someone is about to leave.

They rarely do.

By the time disengagement is visible, the real decision was usually made months earlier. Not suddenly. Not emotionally. Quietly and rationally.

You didn’t miss the signs — you normalized them. You acclimated to a slower, quieter version of that person and assumed that was just how they were now.

This is the asymmetry that matters:

**Employees usually know your intent. You usually do not know their optionality.**

And optionality is power — even when it’s invisible.

## How Misalignment Accelerates Hidden Optionality

Underpaying someone absolutely accelerates this process.

But compensation isn’t the only trigger.

Any persistent misalignment does it:
- pay  
- growth  
- workload  
- respect  
- trust  
- clarity  

Once an employee recognizes the gap — and realizes it isn’t being addressed — they start building an exit quietly.

Not dramatically.  
Not vindictively.  
Efficiently.

Here’s the mistake managers make:

They assume leverage only exists if they can see it.

But leverage doesn’t need visibility to exist.

While you’re assuming stability, the employee is accumulating options. While you’re interpreting silence as satisfaction, they’re treating it as a signal that the feedback loop is closed.

By the time you feel the risk, the risk has already been priced in.

## Pressure-Testing the Common Objections

**“They accepted the offer.”**

Yes. At the time, it may have been the best option available.

Accepting an offer isn’t a lifetime commitment. It’s a decision made with incomplete information and limited leverage. Over time, skills increase, visibility improves, and external options expand.

The original agreement becomes a reference point — not a constraint.

---

**“The market changed.”**

Markets always change.

Employees know this. Employers know this. And both sides know that the other knows.

If market movement consistently benefits the company but never the employee, it isn’t interpreted as bad luck. It’s interpreted as a signal about priorities.

At that point, the employee doesn’t need the market to stabilize. They just need it to confirm what they already suspect.

---

**“They should’ve told me.”**

This assumes:
- it felt safe to say  
- it seemed likely to matter  
- it wouldn’t backfire  

In many organizations, none of those conditions exist.

Silence doesn’t mean satisfaction. It often means the feedback loop is already considered closed. Once speaking up has more downside than upside, communication stops — not out of spite, but out of efficiency.

Interviewing is quieter and safer than honesty.

## Closing

What surprises managers isn’t that people leave.

It’s *when*.

By the time you’re aware of the risk, the decision has usually already been made — quietly, rationally, and without drama. Not because the employee was dishonest, but because the system rewarded silence and penalized exposure.

Common knowledge tells employees exactly where they stand with you.  
What you don’t see is how many options they’ve been building while you assumed stability.

Leverage doesn’t announce itself.  
Optionality doesn’t need permission.

And when someone finally leaves, it rarely marks the moment things broke — only the moment you were forced to notice.
