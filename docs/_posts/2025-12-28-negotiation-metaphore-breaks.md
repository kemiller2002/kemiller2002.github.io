## Where the Magic Metaphor Breaks

Yesterday I compared negotiation to magic.

Today I want to talk about where that metaphor stops being useful.

Not every negotiation should feel like a performance.

Magic only works because everyone opts in.  
The moment consent becomes unclear, the illusion stops being harmless.

There are negotiations where transparency isn’t optional.  
Where power is uneven.  
Where one side can’t afford to “play along.”

In those situations, inevitability isn’t elegant.  
It’s dangerous.

That’s usually where people become uncomfortable with negotiation tactics.  
Not because guidance is wrong.  
But because pressure gets disguised as cleverness.

### The line that matters

The boundary is simpler than it sounds.

If someone has to stay because they can’t leave, it isn’t a negotiation.

Walking away isn’t drama.  
It’s the mechanism that keeps the system ethical.

The ability to disengage is what makes participation meaningful.  
Remove that, and the process changes entirely.

### When the rules change

When walking away isn’t possible, the role of negotiation shifts.

You don’t design paths.  
You surface truth.

You stop managing outcomes and start clarifying reality.  
You stop adjusting structure and start naming constraints.

That’s where magic stops being appropriate.

### Why this distinction matters

The danger isn’t the metaphor itself.  
It’s using it where it doesn’t apply.

Mistaking inevitability for skill  
or pressure for alignment  
is how people justify outcomes that quietly harm trust.

And trust, once broken, carries a long memory.

### The quiet conclusion

Some negotiations benefit from subtlety.  
Others demand clarity.

Knowing which one you’re in  
is more important than any tactic you bring with you.

Still thinking about how often those get confused  
and how expensive that confusion can be.
