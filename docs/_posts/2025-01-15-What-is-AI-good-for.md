I recently participated in a discussion that centered around the question, “What is AI good for?” The general sentiment seemed to be one of indifference—most people weren’t particularly impressed or inspired by its potential.

One of my friends, who has been blind for quite some time, brought a perspective that stood out. He’s a technologist who closely follows trends, particularly those related to usability. During a conversation at Thanksgiving, we all talked about where AI might truly shine, and his response was simple and straightforward: “It will make complex tasks easier for me.”

Reflecting on his comment, I realized something broader: AI could allow us, as designers, to be forgiven for the egregious mistakes we make when designing something.

This idea reminded me of my grandmother, who passed away in the mid-90s. For several years before that, she lost much of her vision to macular degeneration. Cooking was her passion—her defining activity—but her deteriorating eyesight eventually made it impossible to read the dials on the stove. On my grandparents’ range, the middle dial controlled the oven. Her solution was simple: she placed a dot where the dial needed to be set to preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Fast forward to today’s appliances, and such workarounds are nearly impossible. My toaster oven alone has three dials and two buttons—an unnecessary complexity that excludes anyone who can’t easily navigate it.

My dad, now in his mid-80s, faces similar challenges as his eyesight declines. He enjoys watching the news and the History Channel, but something as simple as typing in a channel number to watch WTHR is becoming obsolete. We’ve collectively accepted a level of complexity for trivial tasks that were once effortless.

Consider getting a ride. Calling a cab used to be a simple phone call. Today, services like Uber require navigating a visually complex app, designed for sighted users comfortable with modern technology. As people age and the world becomes more complex, their worlds shrink. Eventually, they are left with only a few familiar rooms—spaces that don’t change, where they can move without effort or fear.

So, what will AI be useful for? I hope it will serve as a tool to prevent us from punishing others for our design decisions and our lack of understanding. AI has the potential to simplify—not complicate—lives, enabling a world where tasks remain accessible, regardless of age, ability, or circumstance.
