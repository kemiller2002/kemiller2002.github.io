I have been fortunate enough to be allowed to speak at Indy.Code() which really means I'm grateful to get the chance to listen to all the other speakers. If you live anywhere around the Midwest, or can travel to Indianapolis, I highly recommend you come and watch the talks. It's going to be an amazing event with some unbelievably great speakers. A fun time will be had by all. (Unless you hate fun, then you probably won't like it so much. For everyone else, it'll be pretty great!)
