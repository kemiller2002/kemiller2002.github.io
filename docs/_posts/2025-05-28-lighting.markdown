We were shopping for higher-end lighting—ceiling fans, fixtures, and accent pieces that would complement the design of our home while solving some practical issues. The house has its challenges: vaulted ceilings, aging electrical work, and inconsistent airflow from room to room. Choosing the right lighting wasn’t as simple as browsing a catalog. We needed someone who could come to the house, see the space firsthand, and guide us through the right options.

The first store we visited was visually impressive. The displays were elegant, and the salesperson was polished and knowledgeable. She worked on commission and clearly knew the product line. But when we asked if someone could visit the house to assess the space, the conversation shifted. She told us, politely, that it was not something they typically did. She suggested we bring in photos instead. It became clear that unless there was a direct, immediate sale involved, she had little interest in engaging further.

So we moved on.

The second store was more understated, but the experience was markedly different. The person assisting us was salaried and had no financial stake in our purchase. Still, she offered to come to the house, ask questions, and help us make an informed decision.

And she followed through. She walked the space, measured ceiling heights, reviewed wiring logistics, and asked thoughtful questions. She even advised against some of the more expensive fixtures we had considered, not because they were unsuitable from a style perspective, but because they would not function well in our particular environment.

The difference was clear.

The individual who stood to gain the most financially disengaged at the first sign of inconvenience. The one who had nothing to gain showed up and delivered exactly what we needed.

Economists might refer to this as a misalignment of incentives or a principal-agent problem. But in practical terms, it was a lesson in professionalism and integrity.

Some people only take action when there is a tangible reward. Others do the work because they believe in doing it right.

In the end, we chose to give our business to the one who showed up—not because she had to, but because she cared enough to help.
