  <h2>How I Think About Complex Problems</h2>
  <p>
    Most failures I see are not caused by lack of effort. They come from acting on a story before the system is understood.
    I default to evidence first, reversible moves when possible, and clear definitions when the situation is ambiguous.
  </p>
  <p>
    The public home for that decision-making approach is <a href="https://decisionposture.com">Decision Posture</a>.
    It is a practical method for clarity under uncertainty without freezing progress.
