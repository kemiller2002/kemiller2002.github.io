The book comes out this month, by <a href="http://davefancher.com/" title="Dave's Blog" target="_blank">Dave Fancher</a> F# MVP.  It's a great book!  It has an easy to read narrative and a fun style, and is designed for .Net Object Oriented people who want an introduction to both functional programming and to learn F#.  It's a great reference book and learning tool.  Even if you don't want to program F#, the functional approach to programming will teach you a lot, with great examples and easy to read explanations.  I can honestly say the book never gets old. (I was the technical reviewer and got to read each chapter about 4 times.  Think about how many technical books you would read 4 times without contemplating putting a fork in your eye.  Honestly, with his I didn't, and the inside sci-fi references are fun too!)  

On top of this, the introduction is awesome, and it explains exactly why you want to learn functional programming and F#.

The book can be found on the <a href="http://www.nostarch.com/fsharp" title="F Sharp Link" target="_blank">No Starch Press site</a>.
