We were buying lights. Not glamorous ones—just the kind of ceiling fans and fixtures that make a house a little less dark and a little more livable. The showroom was full of options, but our situation was complicated. Older wiring. Odd ceiling angles. A mix of modern and antique fixtures. We needed someone to come to the house, see the space, and offer some guidance.

The woman who initially helped us worked on commission. She was pleasant enough in the store—knowledgeable, even persuasive—but when we asked if she could come take a look in person, she hesitated. She asked a few questions, then deferred. “That’s not really part of what I do,” she said, smiling tightly. “I’d have to refer you to someone else for that.”

That someone else turned out to be a salaried employee—no commission, no incentive to push product, no financial reason to spend her afternoon with us. But she did. She showed up. Walked the house, measured fan clearances, made suggestions about wiring paths and light throw. She even advised us not to buy certain fixtures that would have made the store more money. And she did it all with quiet competence and no expectation of reward.

It struck me: the person who had the most to gain financially did the least. The one who had nothing to gain showed up.

There’s probably a name for this. Incentive misalignment. Moral hazard. The principal-agent problem. But those are economist terms. What it really felt like was a test of character.

Work reveals people. Some only move when there's a carrot dangling in front of them. Others move because they believe in doing the job right—because showing up is part of who they are, not just what they’re paid for.

And in that moment, I knew exactly who I wanted to buy from.
