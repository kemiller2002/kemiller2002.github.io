we're going to talk about resumes, but first we're going to start off discussing plating food and why it's important.

At my house, we're pretty laid back for dinner. The times vary, and sometimes the kids grab their food and head back to their room because they are in the middle of something the feel strongly about continuing. The napkins are always paper, and we sit around a table that I've had for 20 years, and has moving mutliple times, pets, babies, parties, and just about everything else possible that you could do to it. The plates we use have patterns on them, which many would consider a sin and unforgivable when talking about presentation. they are either plates that may parents had and we slike thme, or it was oens that we bought for a party and they are convenient.

Plating is really an art. A lot time is spent putting food on a plate, seeng how it looks, and making chaniges befreo deciding on a layout for a dish to serve to 100s of guests over and over. At home, none of my family cooks the meal before to determine what it's going to look like on the plate, like most families at home we just guess and hope for the best. No one at home will care, that the carrots should be a couple of inches higher towards the top, or the protein is off center when it sholdn't be. I learned pretty early on ther eis one thing that you can easily tell if someone cares or not. What does the plate look like? Not the position of the food, or anything like that, but the plate itself. It takes maybe 30 seconds to get a paper towel or a rag and wipe down the edges of a plate. Are the borders on the plate clean? Next time you go to a resturant, just look. Is the soup on the edge of teh bowl like they slopped it in? Did they leave finger prints when putting on the burger? It's just a little detail that you show you're paying attention. I am far from perfect especially when cooking at home, but that is the one thing we always do. Even for my dad who is blind we always make sure the we clean up the dish before handing it to him. Why? Becauwe we care about what we do. We may not be perfect, but that is one thing that shows, "I have enough self respect that even thought it might not have turned out how I want it, it still have an amount of pride I put into it."

What does this have to do about resumes? You're resume is a reflection on who you are. I'ts a record of the times you have toiled and pushed and struggled to accomplish and did something you are proud of. Something of recognition.
