One conversation that’s always stuck with me was about the role of ideas in the creative process. I was speaking with someone who owned a software company specializing in iOS applications at the time. On the wall behind his desk, there was a poster about breaking rules, not caring what others think, and just making things. It perfectly reflected his mindset.

We were talking about the pursuit of great ideas when he said something that really stayed with me: “A couple years into the business, we applied an idea we’d come across, and that’s what helped us take off.”

This was around the time the iPad was about to launch, and Apple was actively looking for new apps to help showcase the device. A friend had come to him with an idea for an app that showed people how to make the perfect Caesar salad. His reaction? “Honestly, we were lukewarm on it. It didn’t really showcase the hardware, it wasn’t interactive—it felt pretty basic.”

They decided to take a chance on it anyway. They invested real effort—sent out designers and photographers, refined every detail, and brought the app to life. Apple ended up discovering it, and it became one of the featured apps during the iPad launch.

His takeaway was powerful: “What we learned is that you can have a mediocre idea, execute it well, and end up with something amazing.”

That stuck with me. A great idea is nice—but it’s just a start. Even something simple or familiar, with enough thought, care, and creativity, can become something remarkable.
