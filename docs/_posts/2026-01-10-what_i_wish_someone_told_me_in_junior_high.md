title: "What I Wish Someone Told Me in Junior High About Learning"

There’s a moment in everyone’s childhood when learning stops being automatic and starts requiring actual effort.  
For me, that moment hit hard in junior high.

Up until then, learning felt frictionless—especially with math.  
Numbers made sense.  
Steps were clear.  
Teachers moved at a pace I could follow.

Then everything changed.

Suddenly the problems weren’t obvious.  
The logic didn’t click immediately.  
The pace sped up.  
The explanations got thinner.

And because I didn’t understand how learning *really* works, I came to the worst possible conclusion:

### **“If this is hard, it must mean I’m not good at it.”**

No one corrected that belief.  
No teacher.  
No adult.  
No system that explains what’s happening inside your head when you hit a real challenge for the first time.

So I internalized the wrong story—one that stuck with me for years.

Now, decades later, I know exactly what I wish someone had told me in junior high.

---

# **1. Difficulty isn’t a threat — it’s a signal.**

When something becomes hard, your brain isn’t failing.  
It’s *growing.*

But at that age, difficulty feels like danger.

No one explains that difficulty is simply the boundary between what you know and what you’re about to know.  
It’s the doorway into your next level of ability.

Kids interpret difficulty emotionally.  
Adults interpret it cognitively.

If someone had told me:

**“This feels hard because you’re learning something new, not because you’re incapable,”**

everything would have changed.

---

# **2. Confusion is not a verdict. It’s a phase.**

In junior high, confusion feels permanent.

You don’t yet know that everyone—the smartest students included—hits fog before clarity.  
Confusion isn’t the end of learning; it’s the beginning.

Had someone told me:

**“Being confused means you’re in the right place,”**

I would’ve taken a breath instead of panicking.

---

# **3. You don’t need to understand everything at once.**

The biggest sabotage I made as a kid was thinking learning had to be instant.

If I didn’t understand something *right away*, I assumed I never would.

No one told me that:

- understanding is iterative  
- steps stack slowly  
- mastery looks like repetition, not brilliance  
- clarity shows up after exposure, not before  

Learning works like compounding interest: slow at first, then fast once the structure clicks.

---

# **4. Asking for help is a strength, not an admission of failure.**

If you grow up thinking intelligence means “getting it on your own,” you will suffer quietly.

That was me.

I didn’t ask teachers to slow down.  
I didn’t ask classmates to explain things.  
I didn’t ask anyone to sit with me until it clicked.

What I wish I’d been told:

**“Asking for help is what smart people do.  
Struggling alone is optional — and unnecessary.”**

---

# **5. Your pace has nothing to do with your potential.**

Some kids understand new concepts instantly.  
Some take a week.  
Some need examples or analogies.  
Some need to see the whole structure before the details make sense.

Every pace is valid.

The kid who learns slowly but steadily will eventually outpace the kid who learns quickly but quits early.

But in junior high, no one tells you that pace doesn’t predict potential.

---

# **6. What feels impossible now will feel obvious later.**

Almost everything I once thought I “just wasn’t good at” eventually became easy—*once I revisited it without fear.*

Math.  
Algorithms.  
Data structures.  
Complex systems.  
All the things I once avoided.

The difficulty was temporary.  
The fear was the only thing that made it feel permanent.

Someone should have said:

**“The future version of you will understand this.  
You just have to give yourself time to become them.”**

---

# **7. The story you tell yourself matters more than the subject.**

The subject wasn’t the problem.  
The story was.

“I’m not good at this”  
is a story that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

“I don’t get it yet, but I will”  
is a story that builds capability for a lifetime.

If someone had taught me *how to talk to myself* about difficulty, everything would have changed.

---

# **If I could go back and talk to that version of me, I’d tell him this:**

You’re not falling behind.  
You’re not losing your intelligence.  
You’re not broken.  
You’re not lacking talent.

**You’re learning.  
And learning feels like this.**

Nothing is wrong with you.  
Something is *happening* to you.

And once you understand how learning really works, nothing—absolutely nothing—will ever feel impossible again.
