title: "Everyone Starts at Zero: The Lie We Tell Ourselves About Hard Things"

We talk about hard things as if they belong to someone else.  
As if mastery is a gift that a select few were handed at birth.

But the truth is far less glamorous and far more empowering:

**Everyone starts at zero.**  
No exceptions. No prodigies who sit at a piano for the first time and play Chopin.  
No mathematician who understood calculus before learning to add.  
No experienced engineer who didn’t once stare blankly at their first error message.

We forget this because we meet people at the *end* of their staircase, not the beginning. We see their competence, not the climb. We see the results, not the repetitions.

And that creates a lie that follows us into adulthood:

> “If I’m not good at this immediately, I must not be capable of it.”

This belief keeps people from even taking the first step. It convinces them that difficulty is a verdict instead of an invitation. It’s easier to declare something “too hard” than to admit we are afraid of being beginners again.

Here’s the part most people never tell you:

### **Hard isn’t a fixed state. It's a temporary one.**
Every expert was once overwhelmed.  
Every master once felt lost.  
Every confident professional once questioned whether they belonged.

The only real difference between the people who become great at something and the people who don’t is this:

**Some people keep walking up the staircase. Others convince themselves the wall is unclimbable.**

You don’t need extraordinary talent.  
You don’t need a perfect plan.  
You don’t even need confidence.

You just need a willingness to take the next step — and then the next one after that.

Because nothing is beyond your reach if you’re willing to start at zero.

And whether you realize it or not, everything you’ve ever mastered started exactly the same way.

With one small, imperfect step forward.
