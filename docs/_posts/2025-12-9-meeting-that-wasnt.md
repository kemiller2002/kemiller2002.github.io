title: "The Meeting That Wasn't a Discussion"

**Most people walk into a meeting thinking it is a discussion.  
But sometimes... it is actually a negotiation.**

Years ago, we had a production issue affecting real clients.  
Serious enough to deserve attention, but not serious enough to justify panic.

Another group wanted to push out a fix late on a Friday afternoon.  
Right before a long weekend.

If you have ever worked in technology, you know exactly why that is a bad idea.  
Friday releases are famous for turning small problems into long, miserable outages.  
The kind that stretch across Saturday, Sunday, and sometimes even Monday.

We walked into the room believing we were going to talk it through:  
What is the risk?  
What is the safest path?  
What is the right move for the system?

But the moment the meeting started, it became clear that this was not a conversation.  
It was someone trying to push a decision through loudly, forcefully, and with a kind of urgency that felt more like ego than clarity.

That is when the tone shifts.  
Suddenly it is not “What should we do?”  
It is “Here is what I want, and one of us is going to win.”

And here is something a lot of quieter leaders learn the hard way:

**Loudness is not leadership.  
It is pressure.  
And pressure can make smart teams do dumb things.**

So we laid it out plainly:

If we push this now and it goes wrong, the system could be down for days.  
And if that happens, you will be the one who signs off on the responsibility.

The room changed instantly.

Because loud voices almost never want ownership.  
Only control.

And once responsibility entered the conversation, the urgency evaporated.  
Suddenly the “must fix this right now” became “let’s wait until Tuesday.”

Funny how that works.

The lesson I keep relearning is this:

**Most people do not realize they are in a negotiation until they are already losing it.**

Quiet leadership is not about matching someone else’s volume.  
It is about holding your ground with clarity, patience, and boundaries.

Especially when the loudest voice in the room is the one trying to skip those things.
