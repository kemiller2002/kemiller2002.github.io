  <div class="card">
    <p>Kevin M. Miller is a systems thinker and engineering leader who treats complex problems as evidence problems first. He works in uncertainty and constraint without rushing to a story. His default is clarity before irreversible action.</p>

    <p>That approach shows up in software engineering, security, and compliance where the cost of mistakes is real. It also shows up in medical and legal documentation where precision matters more than speed. He looks for patterns across technical and organizational failures, especially in legacy environments under pressure.</p>

    <p>Echelon Foundry is the advisory expression of this work. HelixNote applies the same discipline to documentation in high-stakes cases. Decision Posture is the public articulation of how he makes decisions when the data is incomplete.</p>

    <p>He is drawn to situations where the system is already stressed and the stakes cannot be hand-waved. He works best with leaders who want clear thinking, accountable decisions, and outcomes that hold up over time.</p>
